### YACReader
- [Homepage](https://www.yacreader.com/)
- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yacreader/yacreaderlibraryserver)

Preferred manga/comic server. Native iOS support. Doesn't have any automatic tagging or metadata collection. It follows the folder structure that the comics are in from the filesystem, which I prefer.
